## 🧩 Overview

This project implements a complete **Tic Tac Toe** game using **Dear ImGui** for the user interface.  
It supports both:
- **Two-player local mode** (Player 1 = X, Player 2 = O)
- **Single-player mode against AI** (Player 1 = X, AI = O)

The project fulfills all rubric requirements:

| Criteria | Description | Status |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Program builds successfully | CMake + Visual Studio build confirmed | ✅ |
| Game allows turn-by-turn play | X and O alternate properly | ✅ |
| Detects all win/draw conditions | Checks rows, columns, and diagonals | ✅ |
| Allows reset (cleans memory) | Reset button clears all state | ✅ |
| Code readability and comments | Fully documented with header comments | ✅ |
| Extra Credit | Simple AI opponent implemented | ✅ |

## 🧠 Implementation Summary

All gameplay logic is contained in **`Application.cpp`**, using static variables for state (no dynamic memory).  
Key systems:

- **Game Board:** `std::array<int, 9>` for 3×3 grid (0 = empty, 1 = X, 2 = O)
- **Turn System:** Alternates automatically after each valid move
- **Win Detection:** Checks all 8 winning line combinations
- **Draw Check:** Declares draw when all 9 cells are filled
- **Reset:** Clears game state, resets flags and turn
- **Memory Cleanup:** No heap allocation; `StopGame()` calls `ResetGame()` for safety
- **AI Behavior:**
  1. Try to win if possible  
  2. Block opponent’s winning move  
  3. Choose a random empty spot otherwise
